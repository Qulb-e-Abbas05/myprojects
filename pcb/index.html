However, the ban imposed on him was lifted on appeal.[5] In 2008, Akhtar was banned for five years for publicly criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board,[6] although in October 2008, the Lahore High Court suspended the ban and Akhtar was selected in the 15-man squad for the Twenty20 Quadrangular Tournament in Canada.[7] Akhtar retired from international cricket after the 2011 World Cup.

During the 2019 Coronavirus pandemic, he was involved in helping people across Balochistan during the lockdown in the country.
